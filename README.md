# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description

Use a daily planner to create a schedule. Open the planner, and the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.
Scroll down for color coded hourly time blocks. Grey indicates the past, red is the present, and green is the furture. When you click into a time block you can enter an event. Then click the save button for that time block and the text for that event is saved in local storage. When you refresh the page the saved events persist.
